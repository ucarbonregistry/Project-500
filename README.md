The project activity includes development, design, engineering, procurement, finance, construction,
operation and maintenance of Vaayu 51.2 MW wind power project (“Project”) in the Indian state of
Gujarat to provide reliable, renewable power to the Gujarat state electricity grid which is part of
Indian grid. The Project leads to reduce greenhouse gas emissions because it displaces electricity
from grid connected fossil fuel-based electricity generation plants. The Project involves 64 wind
energy converters (WECs) of 800 kW E-53 with internal electrical lines connecting the Project with
local evacuation facility.

The first WEC under the project activity was commissioned on 25 June 2010 and the last WEC
under the project activity was commissioned on 4 July 2011. The expected operational lifetime of
the project is 20 years.

The details of the registered project are as follows:
Vaayu (India) Power Corporation Private Limited (VIPCPL) is developing 51.2 MW wind farm in
the state of Gujarat in India. The project activity involves supply, erection, commissioning and
operation of 64 machines of rated capacity 800 KW each. The machines are Enercon E-53 make.
The project will generate 115.312 GWh of electricity per year which shall be supplied to the state
electricity utility thereby reducing the energy demand supply gap in the state of Gujarat. The
project activity will assist the sustainable growth of the region by providing clean and green
electricity to the state electricity grid.

The purpose of the project activity is to generate emission free and environment friendly electricity
from the wind energy potential available in the region. The project is expected to generate and
supply 1,15,312.44 MWh of electricity annually to the Indian grid. The project thus addresses the
demand–supply gap in the state of Gujarat and will assist the sustainable growth, conservation of
resources and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by using renewable energy source like wind
energy. The project activity will contribute towards reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission
from the atmosphere, which has been estimated to be approximately 92,238 tCO2e per year, by
displacing an equivalent amount of electricity generation through the operation of existing fuel mix
in the grid comprising mainly of fossil fuel-based power plants. Thus, the project does not only
reduce the demand-supply gap of the respective grid, but also helps in reducing other pollutants
like SOx, NOx, etc. from the atmosphere. In the absence of the project activity the equivalent
amount of electricity would have been generated from the connected/ new power plants in the
Indian grid, which are/ will be predominantly based on fossil fuels.

This is also the pre-project scenario. The technology employed for the project is well proven and
safe. Wind World (India) Limited (hereinafter referred as “Wind World” or “WWIL”) is the
equipment supplier and the Operation and Maintenance contractor for the Project.
Relevant dates for the project activity (e.g. construction, commissioning, continued operation
periods, etc.):

The starting date of operation of the project activity is 14/02/2011, when the first machine of the
project was commissioned.
